				Hello I'm Simon

			<p> I'm not a webmaster, a developper or what you want, but I admit this is kinda fun to do. I'm 19 and I will try to introduce some hobbies in this profile page entirely coded by me ðŸ˜Ž.

			<h2>Sport
			</h2>
			<p>I pratice a sport since I'm 5 years old. I always have been good at sport but just one wasn't enough for me. So I did basketball, tennis, judo ,  badminton, football, volleyball and handball. The one I practiced the most is badminton during 7 years and I currently go to gym try to turn into Schwarzy.ðŸ’ª

			<h2>Cooking
			</h2>
			<p>Cooking is an activity that many consider a chore. In my opinion, it is a small pleasure for which it is necessary to allocate time, and if you think that a good meal is prepared in 2 minutes, of course you will be disappointed! Nothing better than cooking a great meal for your family or friends and seeing their faces smiling and relaxed, and grateful for your work!

			<h2>Travels
			</h2>
			<p> I like to travel a lot and I am proud and happy to have had the chance to visit several countries: Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, USA, Mexico, Thailand. That's 3 continents, Africa and Oceania are on my list. I would like to add a sentence that I like: "After having traveled around the world, all you want is to be at home", maybe you will recognize from who is this.
